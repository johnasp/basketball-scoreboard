This is a basic JavaScript app using Sass for CSS styling.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Build CSS from Sass:**
   ```sh
   npm run build:sass
   ```
3. **Open `public/index.html` in your browser.**

## Scripts
- `npm run build:sass`: Compiles `src/style.scss` to `public/style.css`.

Feel free to expand the app and styles as needed!
